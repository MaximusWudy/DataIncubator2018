Traffic is among the biggest causes of injuries or deaths in today’s mega cities. With Google map, people are feeling more convenient travelling but not more secured, for that there hasn’t been one product that can alert people about potential traffic accidents on streets they are driving through. During my capstone project, I am about to establish an early warning system called TES (Traffic Early-warning System) that can predict on the probability of accidents based on traffic speed, weather condition, roadwork and unsolved 311 service report on streets in Brooklyn, New York City. This system can further be embedded into navigators like Google Maps to make safer trip planning.
